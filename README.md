### *Neuroscience*

[Allen Brain Atlas](https://portal.brain-map.org/atlases-and-data/bkp/abc-atlas): gene expression data for mouse and human brains

[Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)](https://adni.loni.usc.edu/data-samples/): MRI datasets for Alzheimer’s research, PET scans, Neuropathology- all kinds of data

[Big Brain](https://bigbrainproject.org/): high-resolution 3D human brain model, super cool

[BrainMaps](https://brainmaps.org/): high-resolution brain images from multiple species, like BigBrain but older

[DREAM](https://bridges.monash.edu/projects/The_Dream_EEG_and_Mentation_DREAM_database/158987)- EEG data and reported dreams

[E11 Bio](https://e11.bio/): modeled the fly brain, are doing the same with a mouse brain; 5 years, $100M, needs better AI

[MicroONS Explorer](https://www.microns-explorer.org/): pretty deep brain imaging

[OpenNeuro](https://openneuro.org/): diverse neuroimaging datasets, BIDS-compliant MRI, PET, MEG, EEG, and iEEG data
